Twanjo
=========

Twanjo has a simple mission: **learn everywhere**. For that reason our source code is open, and anyone is free to learn and contribute. It's still under development, so don't go run this on your space shuttle yet please :)

Twanjo's core code is based on [IronZebra](http://github.com/hermanschaaf/ironzebra), A blog engine by Herman Schaaf, written in Go, and based on the Revel framework.
